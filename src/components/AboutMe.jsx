          I&apos;m a self-taught developer who enjoys designing and building
          complex back-end systems and minimalist front-ends. I also love
          creating fun projects while watching movies and series. Recently, I
          started reading books and have completed seven so far. I enjoy
          backpacking from time to time. I&apos;m into mechanical keyboards and
          own three of them, Additionally, I&apos;ve started learning German,
          so, Guten Tag!

          I&apos;m more of a &quot;less talk, more work&quot; kind of person.
